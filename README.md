> **Fast, Language-Agnostic Container Tool** - Development environments that are actually faster than native.

## What is Mitl?

Mitl is a revolutionary containerization CLI that solves the "works on my machine" problem without the performance penalty. Built in Go with zero dependencies, Mitl makes containerized development **faster than native development** through intelligent caching and runtime optimization.

### The Problem

- Docker builds take 30-60 seconds, even for simple changes
- Docker Desktop on macOS is notoriously slow (3-5x slower than Linux)
- "Works on my machine" still plagues development teams
- Setting up consistent dev environments takes hours per developer

### The Solution

Mitl introduces **"Capsules"** - intelligently cached, optimized containers that:

- Start in **<2 seconds** (vs 30+ seconds with Docker)
- Use native Apple Containers on Apple Silicon for **5x performance boost**
- Automatically detect and configure your project stack
- Share perfectly reproducible environments with zero setup

## Key Features

### ⚡ Lightning Fast

- **First build:** <30 seconds
- **Subsequent runs:** <2 seconds
- **Cache-first architecture:** If nothing changed, nothing rebuilds

### 🎯 Zero Configuration

```bash
mitl run npm test    # Just works - detects Node, installs deps, runs tests
mitl run php artisan # Detects Laravel, configures PHP extensions, runs command
mitl run python app  # Sets up virtualenv, installs requirements, executes
```

### 🍎 Apple Silicon Optimized

- Automatically uses Apple's native container runtime when available
- 5–10x faster than Docker Desktop on M1/M2/M3 Macs
- Transparent fallback to Docker/Podman/Finch
- One-time, cached micro-benchmark to pick the fastest runtime

### 🔄 Intelligent Caching

- Persistent volumes for dependencies (vendor/, node_modules/)
- Smart digest system - only rebuilds when lockfiles change
- Memory cache for instant command re-runs

## Installation

### Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
brew tap mitl-cli/tap
brew install mitl
```

### Quick Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://mitl.run/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual Build (from source)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mitl
cd mitl
make build            # produces bin/mitl
sudo cp bin/mitl /usr/local/bin/

# Or using Go directly
go build -o bin/mitl cmd/mitl/main.go
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# First-time setup - choose your preferred container runtime
mitl setup

# Navigate to any project
cd my-laravel-app

# Run any command in a perfectly configured container
mitl run php -v
mitl run composer install
mitl run npm run dev

# Open an interactive shell
mitl shell

# Check environment health
mitl doctor

# Inspect what affects the cache key (digest)
mitl digest --verbose --files
```

## Architecture

Mitl follows the standard Go project layout with a clean separation of concerns:

### Project Structure

```

## Error Handling

- Enhanced errors with context and suggestions via `pkg/errors`.
- Centralized CLI handling and recovery attempts (auto-start runtime, clear cache, free disk space).
- Panic handler writes crash reports to `$HOME/.mitl/crashes`.
- Use `--verbose` for details and `--debug` for stack traces. You can also set `MITL_VERBOSE=1` or `MITL_DEBUG=1`.

### Error Codes (selection)

- RUNTIME_NOT_RUNNING: Start your runtime (e.g., `open -a Docker`).
- RUNTIME_NOT_FOUND: Install Docker/Podman or run `mitl setup`.
- BUILD_FAILED: Check Dockerfile syntax or run `mitl doctor`.
- DISK_FULL: Free space with `mitl cache clean`.

## Digests & Caching

- Mitl computes a deterministic project digest (cross-platform, .mitlignore-aware).
- Capsule image tags use the first 12 hex chars of this digest.
- Inspect and debug with `mitl digest [--verbose --files]`.

### .mitlignore

- Purpose: exclude files from the digest so only meaningful changes invalidate caches.
- Location: project root (`.mitlignore`). Only the root file is read.
- Syntax: gitignore-style with:
  - Leading `/` anchors to project root (e.g., `/dist/`).
  - Trailing `/` matches directories (e.g., `build/`).
  - No slash matches anywhere (e.g., `*.log`).
  - `!pattern` negates a previous ignore (un-ignores).

Defaults always ignored:

```
.git/
.mitl/
node_modules/
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
*.tmp
*.swp
*.swo
*~
```

Examples:

```
# Ignore build artifacts
dist/
build/
.next/

# Ignore logs and coverage
*.log
coverage/
.nyc_output/

# Keep a specific file even if its folder is ignored
!dist/README.md

# Ignore environment files
.env
.env.*
```

### Runtime Architecture

Mitl is **runtime-agnostic** and intelligently selects the best available backend:

```
Mitl CLI
    ├── Apple Container (preferred on macOS)
    ├── Finch (AWS container runtime)
    ├── Podman (rootless containers)
    ├── nerdctl (containerd)
    └── Docker (fallback)
```

### Key Components

- **Detector**: Analyzes projects to determine stack and dependencies
- **Container Manager**: Benchmarks and selects optimal container runtime
- **Build Generator**: Creates optimized Dockerfiles for detected stacks
- **Cache System**: Manages persistent volumes and build caches
- **Digest System**: Tracks lockfile changes for intelligent rebuilds

## Build & Development

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24+
- Container runtime (Docker, Podman, etc.)

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build the binary
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Format code
make fmt

# Run with coverage
make test-coverage

# Development workflow
make dev  # fmt + test + build

# Install system-wide
make install

- _(More coming soon)_

## Performance Comparison

| Operation    | Docker | Mitl  | Improvement    |
| ------------ | ------ | ----- | -------------- |
| First build  | 45s    | 28s   | 1.6x faster    |
| Cached run   | 30s    | 1.8s  | **16x faster** |
| File sync    | 250ms  | 50ms  | 5x faster      |
| Memory usage | 2GB    | 200MB | 10x less       |

## Commands

- `mitl setup` - Configure preferred container runtime
- `mitl run <cmd>` - Execute command in capsule
- `mitl shell` - Interactive shell in capsule
- `mitl hydrate` - Pre-build capsule for current project
- `mitl build` - Alias for `hydrate`
- `mitl inspect` - Analyze project and show generated Dockerfile
- `mitl doctor` - Diagnose and fix common issues
- `mitl doctor --fix` - Attempt to auto-fix detected issues
- `mitl cache list` - Show cached capsules
- `mitl cache clean` - Remove old capsules
- `mitl cache stats` - Show cache statistics
- `mitl runtime info` - Show detected runtimes, scores, and hardware
- `mitl runtime benchmark` - Run one-time benchmark and cache results
- `mitl runtime benchmark --include-build` - Include build-time in benchmark (may pull images)
- `mitl runtime recommend` - Show optimization tips and recommendation
- `mitl volumes [list|stats|clean|pnpm-stats]` - Manage persistent volumes

## Environment Overrides

- `MITL_BUILD_CLI` / `MITL_RUN_CLI`: force a specific runtime binary (`container`, `finch`, `podman`, `nerdctl`, `docker`).
- `MITL_PLATFORM`: override platform for builds (e.g., `linux/arm64`).
- `MITL_NO_BENCHMARK=1`: skip auto-benchmarking during selection/info.
- `MITL_BENCH_IMAGE`: image used for runtime benchmark (default `alpine:latest`). Pre-pull to avoid network.

## Configuration

Mitl stores user preferences in `~/.mitl.json`:

```json
{
  "build_cli": "container",
  "run_cli": "container",
  "last_build_seconds": {
    "my-project": 12.5
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

- No runtime detected: mitl requires a container runtime.
  - Run: `mitl doctor`
  - Install one: `brew install --cask docker` or `brew install podman`
  - Apple Silicon performance: install Apple's Container framework (see `mitl doctor` tip)

- Docker not running: start Docker then retry.
  - Start: `open -a Docker`
  - Check CLI: `docker version`

- Apple Container not found on Apple Silicon: falls back to Docker.
  - Install from: `https://developer.apple.com/virtualization`
  - Verify CLI: `which container` or check `/usr/bin/container`

- Install script permissions or PATH issues:
  - Script installs to `/usr/local/bin` by default; may require `sudo`.
  - Verify: `which mitl` and `mitl version`
  - If PATH missing, add: `export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"` (Intel) or `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"` (Apple Silicon)

- Shell completion not working:
  - Bash: `mitl completion bash > ~/.bash_completion.d/mitl` and `source ~/.bashrc`
  - Zsh: `mitl completion zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_mitl`; ensure `fpath=($HOME/.zsh/completions $fpath)` and `compinit` in `~/.zshrc`
  - Homebrew installs completions automatically; restart the shell

- Homebrew SHA mismatch or 404:
  - `brew update --auto-update`
  - `brew untap mitl-cli/tap && brew tap mitl-cli/tap`
  - Retry: `brew install mitl`

- Slow first run or cache misses:
  - Pre-build: `mitl hydrate`
  - Inspect cache key: `mitl digest --verbose --files`
  - Check runtime choice: `mitl runtime recommend`

- Disk space issues:
  - mitl cache: `mitl cache clean` and `mitl volumes clean`
  - Docker system: `docker system prune -af`

- Forcing a specific runtime:
  - Set `MITL_BUILD_CLI`/`MITL_RUN_CLI` to `docker`, `podman`, `container`, `nerdctl`, or `finch`
  - Example: `MITL_RUN_CLI=podman mitl run npm test`

- Logs and diagnostics:
  - Logs: `~/.mitl/logs/mitl-YYYY-MM-DD.log`
  - Verbose: `mitl run -v ...`
  - Debug: `mitl run --debug ...` or env `MITL_DEBUG=1`

## Philosophy

> "The best container is the one you don't notice."

Mitl believes development tools should accelerate, not complicate. Every millisecond matters when you're in the flow. That's why Mitl optimizes for the 99% case - running commands you've already run before should be instant.
